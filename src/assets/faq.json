        "question": "How many cats do you have and what are their names?",
        "answer": "We have two girls, Juliet and Olivia! They also have middle names (Elsa & Jane) — yes, they are fancy LOL. Juliet is my mini-me, you can almost always find her on my lap. She loves to sleep next to me too, but only if she gets covered with a blanket & gets to lay her head next to mine on my (our) pillow. She loves her laser toy, especially when its on the setting that looks like a butterfly. She also LOVES food (and snacks), and would eat once an hour if I allowed it.</p><br><br><p className='paragraph-text'>Olivia is a little explorer. If we go on vacation, she'll walk around immediately into every room very bravely like she owns the place. She loves looking at everything. If there's a door that's closed (like a closet or something), she's going to ask you to open it because she NEEDS to know what's inside. She also likes her private time & asks us to go in the garage where she likes to get her \"me\" time & hang out on her beanbag. She's very friendly & warms up to everyone right away. Both girls are very sweet. They're also very peaceful & gentle — so much so I've seen them both catch bugs a few times, and instead of hurting the bug — they gently \"pet\" the bug, leaving it unharmed.</p>"

        "question": "Do you have any other pets?",
        "answer": "No — these two are a handful. Especially Juliet. She likes to (try) to eat human food, crumb, paper, cardboard, plastic, blankets, etc. She enjoys tearing up carpet/chewing on cords (we had to get cord protectors for everything). Needless to say she keeps us busy."

        "answer": "Maybe! You’re welcome to ask, but whether or not I accept a product review depends on a couple of factors:<br><br>&bull; How much I personally like the product—if it’s something I wouldn’t use myself, I’m likely to decline.<br>&bull; How beneficial I think it’ll be for my cats—if I think my kitties will love it, I’m much more likely to say yes!<br><br>If you’re interested in sending me a product, contact me through our contact page."
