Not only is she a majestic ball of fluff and attitude, but she also has the curious habit of peeing so high, she’s practically trying to mark the ceiling. Yes, you read that right—Juliet doesn’t just pee in the litter box, she sprays over the sides and onto the walls. As you can imagine, this led to some questionable home decor choices: the carpet, the walls, and even the occasional light fixture were all fair game.</p><p>Our first attempt at solving this involved a tarp. Oh, the tarp. We thought, “Surely, this will contain the spray!” Spoiler alert: it didn’t. The tarp was more of a suggestion than a solution. Juliet was determined to defy the laws of physics and her tiny box, leading to several rounds of laundry, frustrated sighs, and the very real fear of stepping in cat pee while we slept.</p><p>What’s even better? The box has a tarp liner that slides right inside. When the inevitable happens, I can pop it out, toss it in the wash, and order a replacement liner from Amazon with just a few clicks. No more soggy carpet, no more mysterious damp spots on the walls—just a clean, dry home and a very satisfied cat (who still has her high-flying pee technique, but at least it’s now contained).</p><p>You can find the magical life-saving litter box <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Modkat-Litter-Scoop-Reusable-Liner/dp/B009UWMLC4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>'''\n",
